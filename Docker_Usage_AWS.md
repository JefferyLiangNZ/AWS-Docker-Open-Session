# Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)

# Elastic Beanstalk 

Elastic Beanstalk supports the deployment of web applications from Docker containers. With Docker containers, you can define your own runtime environment. You can choose your own platform, programming language, and any application dependencies (such as package managers or tools), that aren't supported by other platforms. Docker containers are self-contained and include all the configuration information and software your web application requires to run. All environment variables defined in the Elastic Beanstalk console are passed to the containers. 
By using Docker with Elastic Beanstalk, you have an infrastructure that automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. You can manage your web application in an environment that supports the range of services that are integrated with Elastic Beanstalk, including but not limited to VPC, RDS, and IAM.

An updated Amazon ECS Optimized AMI is available as the default Compute Environment AMI.Â As a general security best practice we recommend that Batch customers replace their existing Compute Environments with the latest AMI available. Instructions for replacing the Compute Environment are available in the Batch product documentation.
Batch customers who do not use the default AMI should contact their operating system vendor for the updates necessary to address these issues. Instructions for Batch custom AMI are available in the Batch product documentation.

# AWS SageMaker

Amazon SageMaker algorithms are packaged as Docker images. This gives you the flexibility to use almost any algorithm code with Amazon SageMaker, regardless of implementation language, dependent libraries, frameworks, and so on. For more information on creating Docker images, see The Dockerfile instructions.
